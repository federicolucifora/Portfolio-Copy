                    criticize the main message of the Netflix's show "Squid Game". The 3D assets were created and
                    animated with Blender, while Premiere Pro and After Effects were used for compositing and audio
                    mixing.</div>

        <div class="projectText storyBox">Squid Game is a series produced by Netflix which has made a fortune for the
            streaming platform. The production was very well received by the audience as it showed a series of
            death
            games that created a lot of suspense. Moreover, it was very clear that the show also proposed a
            strong
            metaphor, depicting what people are capable of for money. However, isn’t it ironic how a series that
            shows money in such a negative light is also the one that made Netflix the most revenue it had ever
            earned? </div>
        <div id="dirty1" class="roundedImage"></div>
        <div id="dirtypiggybankCover" class="roundedImage"></div>
        <div class="projectText storyBox">It is for such a reason that “Dirty Piggy Bank” will try to bring this irony to the
            spectator’s
            eyes. Scenes from the show will be juxtaposed to 3d motion graphics so as to create a clear link to
            the
            money as depicted in Squid Game and the money earned by Netflix with the show. The final result is
            supposed to create a sense of filth by wealth and let the viewer think about whether it is right
            that a
            work is the creator of what it criticizes.</div>
