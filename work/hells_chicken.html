                    was designed and developed for the course of Videogame Design and Programming of Politecnico di
                    Milano, and later published to itch.io as a downloadable demo. The game follows the adventures of
                    Lucifer, who, now a chicken, has fallen to Hell and must escape it, avoiding the monsters who don't
                    recognize him.</div>

        <div class="projectText storyBox">The goal was to create an easy-to-use game with an ironic character. In the
            making of Hell’s Chicken the main focus
            points were placed on the creation of captivating-looking environments that would allow gameplay with
            intuitive mechanics. The 3D environments and game characters were created, rigged and animated with
            Blender.</div>

        <div class="projectText storyBox">Here is the plot of the game: “There was once an angel, the brightest of his kind, whose name
            was Lucifer. Full of arrogance, he rebelled against God, but was thrown into Hell for having tried to
            defy the Creator. In his fall, he saw an unlucky chicken, which he knew would be his only chance to
            escape damnation unnoticed. He then grabbed onto it and dragged it to the depths of Hell, where he
            possessed its body and gave it his powers. Will Lucifer be able to make it back to Heaven and overthrow
            the Ruler?”</div>
